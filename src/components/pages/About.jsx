      Hello and welcome! In my day-to-day life, I love building and making things, from digital work
like some of the projects on this site, modding video games, and physical crafts at my job.
as a lead for a custom design studio where I have made a vast number of things, such as
Christmas ornaments, tarot cards, maps, jewelry boxes, or whatever else a client wants to see made.
This experience and my own passion have made me value the process of starting a project,
creating something step by step and problem solving along the way. I have also had the pleasure of
working with my team to set us up for success and teach them how to make things too.


I am a passionate person; I love weightlifting and yoga, and I love a challenge. I intend to keep
growing and developing my skillset as a coder and as a person. If you need a driven, hard-working
and positive person on your team, then please reach out!
